# LargeScaleDistributedSystems

Large Scale Distributed Systems Project.

This project explores a distributed aggregation algorithm, Push-Sum. This algorithm can be used to compute functions like COUNT, SUM and AVERAGE. A survey of algorithms like this one can be found in: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.0725.pdf . These algorithms focus on the availability and partition properties of the CAP theorem.

The classic Push-Sum Algorithm presents some problems since it does not address the termination of the algorithm, and assumes the existence of a fault detector but without specifying how faults are detected. In this sense, this project tries to address and solve these problems of the original algorithm. Find out more in the [Report](https://github.com/joaop21/Decentralized-Aggregation/blob/master/SDLE_TP_Grupo_10.pdf) of this project.

This project was carried out in the second semester of the fourth year of informatics engineering course at University of Minho. [2019-2020]
